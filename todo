Crafting:

Interface slot storage - an array (for looping) of objects that store their position (easy to position and have gaps).

RecipeBook needs solid search methods, taking strings?

GridCraftingMenu (separate into a parent-child class if this is to be reused in future projects)
	Stores an array of objects - type, current_item
	Array is 1d and divides by width for new rows. Easier to loop through
	Gaps are represented by empty objects or even zeroes or 'false' bools


Use case: You got yellow and green. Add those together, make blue
